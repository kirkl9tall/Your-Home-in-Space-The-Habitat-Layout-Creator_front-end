# NASA Habitat Designer - Development Roadmap

## Current Status âœ…
- Enhanced NASA-compliant module categories (COMPLETE)
- Real-time compliance checker (COMPLETE) 
- Mission duration-based requirements (COMPLETE)
- NASA compliance assistant (COMPLETE)
- Visual clean/dirty/technical indicators (COMPLETE)

## Immediate Next Steps (Priority Order)

### 1. Enhanced Visual Compliance Feedback (NEXT SESSION)
**Goal**: Make compliance violations immediately visible in 3D scene
- [ ] Add red warning lines between violating modules in 3D space
- [ ] Module border colors change based on compliance status
- [ ] Hover tooltips showing NASA compliance info
- [ ] Visual "danger zones" around dirty areas

### 2. Emergency Egress Path Validation (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Goal**: Ensure NASA emergency evacuation requirements
- [ ] Calculate and visualize egress paths
- [ ] Validate maximum travel distance to exits
- [ ] Check corridor width compliance (0.8m minimum)
- [ ] Emergency lighting and access validation

### 3. Advanced Multi-Level Support (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Goal**: Support complex multi-deck habitat designs
- [ ] Vertical stacking compliance rules
- [ ] Stairwell/ladder placement validation
- [ ] Weight distribution analysis
- [ ] Cross-level accessibility checking

### 4. NASA Equipment Integration (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Goal**: Add specific NASA equipment to modules
- [ ] ISS-validated equipment database
- [ ] Equipment placement within modules
- [ ] Power and resource requirement calculations
- [ ] Equipment redundancy validation

### 5. Mission-Specific Optimization (FUTURE)
**Goal**: Destination-specific requirements
- [ ] Mars-specific contamination protocols
- [ ] Lunar dust mitigation requirements
- [ ] Deep space radiation shielding
- [ ] Gravity-level considerations

## Technical Implementation Priorities

### Immediate (This Week)
1. **3D Scene Violation Indicators**: Visual lines/warnings between non-compliant modules
2. **Compliance Score Animation**: Smooth transitions and better visual feedback
3. **Module Validation on Drop**: Immediate feedback when placing modules

### Short Term (Next 2 Weeks)  
1. **Emergency Egress Calculator**: Real path finding and validation
2. **Advanced Adjacency Rules**: More sophisticated NASA separation requirements
3. **Performance Optimization**: Ensure smooth operation with large habitat designs

### Medium Term (Next Month)
1. **Multi-Level 3D Visualization**: True vertical habitat design
2. **Equipment Database Integration**: Real NASA equipment specifications
3. **Export to NASA Format**: Full compatibility with NASA design tools

## Success Metrics
- [ ] 100% NASA adjacency compliance validation
- [ ] Sub-2-minute emergency egress from any point  
- [ ] Support for 50+ module complex designs
- [ ] Real-time performance at 60fps
- [ ] Professional NASA tool integration

## User Experience Goals
- [ ] Drag-and-drop remains intuitive despite complexity
- [ ] Compliance guidance doesn't overwhelm interface
- [ ] Clear learning path for NASA requirements
- [ ] Professional visualization quality
- [ ] Export-ready designs for actual missions
